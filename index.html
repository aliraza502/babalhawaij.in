                <p class="leading-relaxed">Imamat is a matter of great merit. In fact no other issue in Islam is more significant than the subject of Imamat. Its importance lies in the fact that it's the only reliable means after rasoolallah (saws) to reach to the true recognition of Allah . It is only through Imamat that one can obtain the true recognition of Allah and comprehend the manner of worshipping Him. If anyone adopts some means of worshipping Allah other than the one suggested by the Imams (a.s), he will never be successful in his endeavor. As imamat is the part of usule deen roots of Islam (tauhid adl naboovat imamat Qayamat) it becomes more important topic to discuss about in the riwayat we see that rasoolallah (saws) said at the time of ghadeer I'm leaving behind you to weighty things one is Qur'an and other is ahlabaith (imam) if anyone leaves anyone of it will get astray so it become wajib for a person to recognise his imam for the true guidance hence it was felt that why not a brief discussion on imamat can be done which will be helpfull for all of us.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 title-font mb-2">Meaning Of Imamat</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">Meaning of Imamat or khilafat 
                    Al-Imamat (¹) literally means 'To lead'; Al-Imam (ay) means 'The leader. In Islamic terminology, Al-Imamat (L) means universal authority in all religious and worldly affairs in succession to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.).' Al Imam means the man who, in succession to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) has the right to the absolute command of the Muslims in all religious and worldly affairs..The word 'man' signifies that a female cannot be an Imam. Absolute command excludes those who lead in prayers: they are called Imam of the prayers, but they do not have absolute authority. In succession to the Prophet (s.a.w.a.) denotes the difference between a Prophet and an Imam. The Imam enjoys this authority not directly but as a successor of the Prophet.The word Al-Khilafat (o) means 'to succeed and Al-Khalifa (4) means the successor. In Islamic terminology, Al-Khilafat and Al-Khalifa practically signify the same meanings as Al-Imamat and Al-Imam respectively. Al-Wisaya (4) means, "The executorship of the will' and Al Wasiyy (¹) means "the executor of the will. Their significance in Muslim writings is the same as that of al-Khilafat (caliphate) and al-Khalifa (caliph).It is interesting to note that many previous Prophets were also the caliphs of their predecessor Prophets, thus they were Nabi and Khalifah both; while other Prophets (who brought new Shariah) were not caliphs of any previous Prophet. Also, there were those who were caliphs of the previous Prophets but not Prophets themselves.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900 title-font mb-2">Aligiblity Of An Imam</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">For everything there are certain criteria for acceptance which every sensible person checks before adoptiong then why not for such an important and valuable position we get check some of the criteria the essential aligiblity oblig  criteria of the imam mentioned in Quran and riwayat are as under</p>
            
               <br><p class="leading-relaxed">1. Superiority (l):
                like the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), an Imam should excel the Ummat in all virtues such as knowledge, bravery, piety and charity and should possess complete knowledge of the divine law. If this is not so and this high position is entrusted to an inferior man when a superior one is available, it means that the inferior has been given preference over the superior, which is wrong according to reason and against divine justice. Therefore, no inferior person will receive Imamat from Allah when there exists a person Imamat superior to him.'
                </p>
                <br><p class="leading-relaxed">2. Infallibility (c):
                    The second qualification is infallibility (). If the Imam is not infallible (a) he would be liable to error and also deceive others.? Firstly in such a case no implicit confidence may be placed in what he says or dictates to us.
                    <br><br>
                    Secondly an Imam is the ruler and head of the Ummat and the Ummat should follow him unreservedly in every matter. Now, if he commits a sin the people would be bound to follow him in that sin as well. The untenability of such a position is self-evident; for obedience in sin is evil, unlawful and forbidden. Moreover, it would mean that he should be obeyed and disobeyed at one and the same time; that is obedience to him would be obligatory yet forbidden which is manifestly absurd.
                    <br><br>
                    Thirdly if it would be possible for an Imam to commit sin it would be the duty of other people to prevent him from doing so because it is obligatory on every Muslim to forbid other people from unlawful acts. In such a case the Imam will be held in contempt; his prestige will come to an end and instead of being the leader of the Ummat he will become their follower and his Imamat will be of no use.
                    <br><br>
                    Fourthly the Imam is the defender of the divine law and this work cannot be entrusted in fallible hands nor can any such person maintain it properly. For this very reason, infallibility has been admitted to be an indispensable condition to Prophethood and the considerations which make it essential in the case of a Prophet make it so in the case of an Imam and Caliph as well.</p>

                        <p class="leading-relaxed">But as in the case of the prophet (a.s.) the above mentioned qualifications alone are not enough for a Prophet. Similarly one cannot automatically become an Imam based on these qualifications. Imamat is not an acquired position; it is a designation bestowed by Allah.'


                                <br><br>
                            only Allah can appoint a successor to the Prophet; the Ummat has no choice in this matter. Its only duty is to follow such a divinely appointed Imam or Caliph.
                            
                            
                            <br><br>
                            The following verses of the Holy Quran confirm the views <br>
                            و ربك يخلق ما يشاء و يختار ما كان لهم الخيرة سبحان الله و تعالى عما يشركون
                            <br>
                            And your Lord creates and chooses whom He pleases, to choose is not theirs, glory be to Allah and exalted be He above what they associate (with Him). <br> (surah 28 ayat 68)
                            <br><br>
                            This verse clearly shows that man has no right to make selection; it lies entirely in the hands of Allah. 
                            
<br>                            وجعلهم أئمة يهدون بأمرنا. <br>
                            
                            "And We made them Imams who guided (people) by Our Command." <br>(Surah ambiya 21 ayat 73) 
                            <br><br>
                            As we have seen above the importance of imamat we get to know that imamat plays a crucial role in islam and if we don't follow the right imam we will get astray. Now it is important for us to find that who the true imam are?</p>

<br><br>
                            The Prophet (saws) said: "The Religion (Islam) will continue until the Hour (Day of Resurrection), having Twelve Caliphs for you, all of them will be from Quraysh." [Sahih Muslim, (English), Chapter DCCLIV, v3, p1010, Tradition #4483; Sahih Muslim (Arabic), Kitab al-Imaara, 1980 Saudi Arabian Edition, v3, p1453, Tradition #10]
        <br><br>                    
                            
                            Ahmad ibn Ziyad Ibn Jafar al-Hamadani - may God be pleased with him-narrated that <br>
                            "I will leave behind two heavy things with you: God's Book and my 'Itra." He (s) was asked, "What does "my "Itra" mean?" He (s) replied, "It is I, Al-Hassan, Al Hussein and the other nine Divine Leaders from the descendants of Al-Hussein. The ninth of them is their Al-Mahdi (Divinely Guided One) who is their Riser. They will not separate themselves from God's Book and God's Book will not separate from them until they meet God's Prophet (s) at his Pool.
